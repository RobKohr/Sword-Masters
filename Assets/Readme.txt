Content:
 - 3 models of the robot
 - model of the stand for presentation
 - 2 basic textures and 1 normal map for each robot
 - 3 color variants of the texture and 1 normal map for the stand
 - additional textures for lighting effects
 - 2 versions of materials and shaders for robots and stands
 - several prefabs

Rigging robots: yes
Animation: no (I will add in the near future for a few animations for each robot)

For render and demo scenes, I use shaders from the standard asset set of Unity:

-Toon/Basic Outline.shader
-Legacy Shaders/Bumped Specular.shader
-Particles/Alpha Blended.shader

Thank you!
